</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Wow, what a way to start the season.</p>
<p>So I actually started watching this game about 24 minutes in so I didn’t get to see Khedira’s goal live. But, I don’t think I missed much. Anyways, let’s address the elephant in the room. How was CR7’s debut? Overall, not bad. He made a lot of sharp runs and had a couple of decent chances but to no avail. I wasn’t expecting miracles right off the bat, but he didn’t play like his regal self at Real Madrid. But knowing his work ethic and his sheer will to succeed, I know that he will get better over time as he gets used to his teammates and surroundings. </p>
<p>For the vast majority of the game, Juve dominated the match (73% possession with 26 shots on goal, 10 on target). Essentially, the gameplan in the first half was to hit Douglas Costa and Juan Cuadrado on the left and right wings respectively and shower Ronaldo with a buffet of crosses in the box. On paper, this seems to be the correct thing to do since Costa and Cuadrado are both excellent crossers of the ball and Ronaldo is one of the best finishers of all time. However, I would have to admit that Juve looked extremely one-dimensional. Although they pumped in loads of crosses, Chievo dealt with all of them comfortably because they knew that they just needed to mark Ronaldo tightly and clear the crosses. As a result, Ronaldo was totally isolated  up top. To be honest, I don’t think Ronaldo plays well as a lone striker. He needs someone who can create space and deflect the defenders’ attention away from him (like a Benzema). This is why I think it was a huge mistake to let Higuain go to Milan; he can provide that cover for Ronaldo and be another option in attack. I mean they freakin played together at Real Madrid for a while so I know they can play together. In fact, Ronaldo only started to come alive when Mandzukic came in the second half and was moved to the left wing. </p>
<p>Juventus need to do more than pump in crosses from the wing. They need to mix it up. Unfortunately, they lack a playmaker who can create chances out of thin air. Dybala is supposed to be the creative trequartista that links play together in the final third like a Totti or a Zidane, but I don’t think that’s really his game. In my opinion, he’s more of a technically gifted shadow striker who pounces upon space left behind the lead striker and penetrates using his dribbling abilities. Furthermore, I don’t think Juve ever replaced Andrea Pirlo since he left in 2015. Pjanic is pretty decent, especially in dead ball situations but he ain’t no Pirlo, Khedira and Matuidi are like a poor man’s Vidal, and Emre Can remains to be seen. In other words, there’s no one who can dominate the midfield and dictate the tempo like Xavi and Iniesta, Kroos and Modric in recent years. </p>
<p>Defensively, Juventus have to do much better if they want to defend the Scudetto and more importantly, challenge in Europe. As the old adage says, “Offense wins you games but defense wins you championships”. They struggled mightily with Chievo’s counter-attacks which led to 2 goals. I was never a fan of Bonucci and I think it was a mistake to bring him back. He is a mediocre defender with decent ball distribution skills. He’s essentially the Italian version of Gerard Pique. Furthermore, he is chronically prone to brain farts and lapses in concentration, which leads to catastrophic blunders and he’s slow as molasses. For example, look at Chievo’s first goal today. There’s a reason why Milan didn’t do well last season. I think it was better to stick with Benatia and develop Rugani and Caldara throughout the season but oh well. Chiellini is still a world class center back and Alex Sandro is one of the best left backs in the world. I’m not sold on Szczesny as the starting goalkeeper (I prefer Perin) and I’m holding my thoughts on Cancelo until I see more of him. Defense should be Juventus’s bread and butter, the foundation which the team should be built upon. But, they still got ways to go. </p>
<p>I do have to commend my team for not giving up when they were 2-1 down and fight until the end. Allegri made some key substitutions in the second half (Bernadeschi for Cuadrado, Mandzukic for Costa, and later, Emre Can for Khedira). Bernadeschi and Mandzukic provided some much needed dynamism and bite that the Juve offense sorely needed. They took a huge load off of Cristiano offensively and their inclusions ultimately led to the W. </p>
<p>Final thoughts: It wasn’t the prettiest performance from Juventus but they got the job done proving that they are still the team to beat in Italy. They need to shore up their defense and vary their attacking patterns. The new additions still need time and experience to gel together with the team. Overall, a good fighting performance from Juventus. </p>                </article>
